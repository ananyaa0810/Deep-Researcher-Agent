# Deep-Researcher-Agent
Deep Researcher Agent is a Python-based AI system designed to perform in-depth research by searching, analyzing, and synthesizing information from large-scale, locally stored data sources â€” without relying on any external web search APIs. The agent uses local embedding models to index and retrieve documents, supports multi-step reasoning to break down complex queries into manageable subtasks, and generates coherent, context-aware responses. It features an efficient retrieval pipeline powered by vector databases like FAISS or Chroma, and can optionally incorporate local LLMs for response synthesis. Designed for secure and offline environments, this system ensures complete local processing of data. Potential enhancements include summarizing information from multiple sources into structured research reports, interactive follow-up questioning, explainable reasoning steps, and export options for research outputs in formats such as PDF or Markdown.
